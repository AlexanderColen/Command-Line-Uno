# Command_Line_Uno
 Command Line Uno created for the [Habitica Programming Challenge November 2019](https://habitica.com/challenges/07181b41-9ceb-47ac-9e27-3087210af432).
 
 Randomly generates 1000 hands and checks whether they can play on top of a randomly generated top card.
 
 Also includes a possibility for a custom card playability check if the _check_ command line argument is included.
 
 Future expansions will be to make the game playable vs one or more AIs.
